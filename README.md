# Me

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/brianbrowndev/b-me/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

A personal portal for me. Designed to be response and mobile first, Me is a mix of static content (published with org-mode), trips, notes, TODO, etc., and dynamic content. The motivation being the need to organize the content around my life into an application that I can access anywhere, and interact with, if needed.
